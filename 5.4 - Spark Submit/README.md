Spark 2
-------

In 2015, Spark introduced its own take on DataFrames which has since become the primary abstraction for data in Spark. In 2016, Spark 2.0 was released and Databricks worked with Berkeley to create [an edX course](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1%3ABerkeleyX%2BCS105x%2B1T2016/) to teach this new version of the Spark API. To get acquainted with Spark DataFrames, we will jump into the first lecture of this series. The first few videos are a review of what we have already and can be skipped. I include them for completeness:
