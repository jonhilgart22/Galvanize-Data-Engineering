### Course Description

DSCI 6007: Distributed and Scalable Data Engineering will introduce you to working with distributed systems for efficiently collecting and analyzing large quantities of varied data.

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, you should be able to:  
(_not a complete list_)

- Install and run a Linux virtual machine locally and in the cloud
- Utilize \*NIX command line tools to manipulate and analyze data
- Deploy and manipulate data and working code in the cloud
- Write complex SQL queries
- Design a database that conforms to the third normal form (3NF)
- Design, create, and query NoSQL databases
- Identify embarrassingly parallelizable tasks and parallelize them
- Describe and apply the MapReduce algorithm
- Describe and apply Spark's Dataset abstraction
- Apply machine learning in a distributed architecture
- Analyze streaming data "real-time"
- Apply probabilistic data structures to handle high volume/velocity data
- Build and use an information retrieval (IR) or search engine
- *Build an end-to-end distributed data-pipeline*

#### Course Methodology: _What Not How_

Materials for this course will focus more on *what* needs to be accomplished, and less on *how* to accomplish it. That is, you will still need to know how to accomplish these goals, but you may be expected to be more self-reliant on finding and utilizing those materials yourself than you have been in the past. Being able to teach yourself how to use a new technology is essential to your role as a data scientist. These tools evolve quickly and what is wired today will be tired tomorrow. It is not unknown for a tool to be deprecated in the course of a minimester. To the extent that we do provide instructions on "how", and do our best to keep the content of the course as up-to-date as possible, sometimes links will be dead, instructions will be out dated, and so on. You will have to rely on your colleagues and your ingenuity to figure out what to do.

### Required Books

None. Data Engineering is a new and evolving field, and there is no standard book that covers it completely and is current. We will post readings for each day.  They will be video tutorials, book chapters, and blog posts.  

### Optional Books

- [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032175.do) (DDIA) by Martin Kleppmann. Clear, concise, and practical. Right now preview edition only, a game changer when finished.
- [Big Data](http://www.manning.com/marz/) by Nathan Marz with James Warren. Much of the technology has changed since that book was written but the basic principles are the same.
- [Learning Spark](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028512.do) Spark is the new dominant analytics framework. This is an accessible introduction.
- [Advanced Analytics with Spark](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035091.do) Learn how to leverage Spark to solve Data Science problems through guided projects.
- [The Manga Guide to Databases](http://www.amazon.com/Manga-Guide-Databases-Mana-Takahashi/dp/1593271905/) Learn databases without the tedium.

### Class Structure

This course is an "active" learning environment. You'll learn through doing. The focus will be applying concepts to data through programming.

Before class you will complete preparation materials (e.g., watch videos, read chapters, and complete workbooks). All preparation materials should be covered prior to the start of each class session. They are **always required** unless explicitly labeled as optional. These materials will be resource for factual knowledge. We will not be delivering traditional lectures. You are expected to be familiar with the basic concepts and technical jargon by the start of class.

In-class time is precious - We'll reserve it for discussion, presenting complex material, answering questions, and working on exercises.

Typical class structure:

- On Your Own (OYO) activity
- Review yesterday's lab
- RAT about previous material
- Discussion of today's topic
- Conceptual overview and techniques necessary to complete the lab
- Lab: Students work in pairs on the exercise

#### RAT

The Readiness Assessment Tests (RATs) are intended to test your understanding of the materials presented thus far in the course. This includes recent preparation material and items from previous classes. There are 3 parts: individual, small-group, and class

1. Each student will answered all the questions on the RAT individually.
2. Then the class will split into teams of 3-5. Each team will answer the same questions again, the goal is to reach consensus. This is an opportunity for peer-to-peer instruction which is often more effective than lectures!
3. Finally, the answers to the questions will be gone over by the class, hopefully resolving any final misunderstandings before proceeding with the exercises.

### Labs
The RATs are meant to assess the first three levels of [Bloom's Taxonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom's_taxonomy): knowledge, comprehension, and analysis. The project work is meant to develop the latter three levels: analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Students will separate into two (or threes) for "pair programming". These exercises may involve a series of short questions, single day projects, or multi-day projects.

Unless otherwise specified, labs are due before the following class session. (So a lab assigned on Thursday would be due Friday at 11am. A lab assigned on Friday would be due the following Monday at 11am.) Solutions for labs will be given as will partial credit for late assignments. In other words: even if you do not finish the lab in time, it is still worth it to complete it, even after the solution has been given.

#### Pair programming

"Pairing" is where two programmers are working on the same code at the same time. It is a great way to improve as programmer and solve problems. One acts as the "driver", the other as the "navigator". The driver types and the navigator helps. For example, the navigator might name variables or look up documentation. Pairs will change every class.

### Project Presentations

Presentation are one way to demonstrate your learning, but more importantly it is practice for organizing and communicating your work and ideas. The presentations will function similar to code reviews in-front of your peers and instructors, who will function like Senior Developers. The purpose of students presenting work is two-fold:

All students will learn from all exercises, whether or not they had time to complete them in class.
Students will get to see alternative approaches to the exercises they did complete.

### Grades

| Item         | Weight |  
|:------------:|:------:|
| Mastery Tracker | 25% |  
| Labs          | 15% |
| Participation | 10% |  
| Final Project | 50% |

The expected grade for this class is a B+. Getting an A- or above requires completion of the Mastery Tracker, high level participation, and a stellar final project.

#### Mastery Tracking

Mastery Tracking is a tool to provide feedback student learning. Standards are the core-competencies of MSDS graduates - the knowledge, skills, and habits every student should possess by time they graduate. Standards are measurable, student-focused outcomes that state what students are expected to be able to do by the end of the course. Students who are below ‘mastery’ on a standard are expected to continue practicing said standard (with the instructor's guidance) until they reach mastery. What matters is that students eventually learn the material, not how many attempts it takes to get there. The Instructor and Data Scientist in Residence are available to offer feedback and help guide everyone on their mastery journey.

Mastery Tracking uses a 4-point scale. Every student is expected to achieve 3 or above (Mastery) across all Standards by the end of the course. 1s and 2s indicate areas where students need further practice and/or interventions to reach mastery.

##### 4 pt Scale:

0 = Has not been covered  
1 = Falling far below mastery - Meeting none of the success criteria or has egregious errors  
2 = Approaching mastery - Meeting some of the success criteria  
3 = Mastery - Meeting all of the success criteria  
4 = Exceeding mastery - Truly exceeding expectations and demonstrating proficiency at a higher level of rigor  

We will be using Galvanize's Learning Management System (LMS) which can be found at [learn.galvanize.com](https://learn.galvanize.com).

#### Participation

You must also show up prepared. Each person is important to the dynamic of the class, and therefore students are required to participate in class activities.

#### Class Attendance

Attendance is mandatory. It is the responsibility of the student to attend all classes. If you have to miss class, due to sickness or other circumstances, please notify your instructor by Slack in advance. Supporting documents (doctor’s notes) should accompany absences due to sickness. Each excused absences beyond 2 or any unexcused absences will result in lowering your __overall course grade by ⅓ of an entire letter grade__ (A->A-, A->B+). It is at the instructor’s discretion to deny any absences or to allow students to make-up assignments, exams, etc. resulted from any absences.

### Course Requirements

#### Prerequisites

- DSCI6003: Machine Learning and Data Analysis  
- DSCI6004: Natural Language Processing

#### On Languages

This course primarily uses **Python 2.7**. For some assignments (especially with Spark), the **Scala** language may be used. Support for Python 3 in the technologies utilized in this course is sporadic at best and not recommended.

Other languages that will be employed are HTML, SQL, and CQL (Cassandra Query Language).

### Electronic Device Policy
Cell phones can be highly disruptive to the class environment. Please silence these devices. In the event of the need to use electronic devices during an person emergency, please step out of the classroom.

### Late Assignments
All assignments are due by the end of the day on the due date. Unexcused late assignments are given a score of zero. No late assignments will be accepted unless the instructor has expressed permission in advance.

### Academic Integrity
The University of New Haven is an academic community based on the principles of honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. Academic integrity is a core University value which ensures respect for the academic reputation of the University, its students, faculty and staff, and the degrees it confers.

The University expects that all students will learn in an environment where they work independently in the pursuit of knowledge, conduct themselves in an honest and ethical manner and respect the intellectual work of others. Each member of the University community has a responsibility to be familiar with the definitions contained in, and adhere to, the Academic Integrity Policy. Violations of the Academic Integrity Policy include, but are not limited to:

- Cheating -- i.e. Don't read off of your neighbors exams
- Collusion -- Group work is encouraged except on evaluative exams. When working together (on exercises, etc.), acknowledgment of collaboration is required.
- Plagiarism -- Reusing code presented in labs and lectures is expected, but copying someone else's solution to a problem is a form of plagiarism (even if you change the formatting or variable names).
- Facilitating academic dishonesty

Students who are dishonest in any class assignment or exam will receive an "F" in this course. More information regarding UNH’s official academic integrity policies are outlined in [here](http://www.newhaven.edu/334887.pdf).
