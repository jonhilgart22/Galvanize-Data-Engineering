    "3. Rule of Composition: Design programs to be connected to other programs.\n",
    "4. Rule of Separation: Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines.\n",
    "4. Rule of Simplicity: Design for simplicity; add complexity only where you must.\n",
    "5. Rule of Parsimony: Write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do.\n",
    "6. Rule of Transparency: Design for visibility to make inspection and debugging easier.\n",
    "7. Rule of Robustness: Robustness is the child of transparency and simplicity.\n",

    "10. Rule of Least Surprise: In interface design, always do the least surprising thing.\n",
    "11. Rule of Silence: When a program has nothing surprising to say, it should say nothing.\n",
    "12. Rule of Repair: When you must fail, fail noisily and as soon as possible.\n",
    "13. Rule of Economy: Programmer time is expensive; conserve it in preference to machine time.\n",
    "14. Rule of Generation: Avoid hand-hacking; write programs to write programs when you can.\n",
    "15. Rule of Optimization: Prototype before polishing. Get it working before you optimize it.\n",
    "16. Rule of Diversity: Distrust all claims for “one true way”.\n",
