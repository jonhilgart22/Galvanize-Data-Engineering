- Completed Lesson 1 of Cloud Computing Concepts, Part 1

----

For this lesson, we will be borrowing from Indranil Gupta's course on Cloud Computing. I recommend you enroll to audit the course for free at [coursera.org/learn/cloud-computing/home/welcome/](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cloud-computing/home/welcome) as that will give you access to quizzes and other helpful resources. However, to make sure you always have access to the videos (even if Coursera decides to close this course) we are mirroring the videos on S3. Links to both are provided below.

We begin with the question: [Why Clouds?](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cloud-computing/lecture/LAkcU/1-1-why-clouds) <small>([S3 version](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dsci/6007/videos/cloud-computing/1-1-why-clouds.mp4))</small> In a lot of ways, this video recapitulates much of what was already discussed in the [Course Overview](../Course Overview/README.md), but if you are still unsure as to why we are bothering with this thing called "the Cloud", you might want to watch it to review.

Next we get to: [What is a cloud?](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cloud-computing/lecture/rttaf/1-2-what-is-a-cloud) <small>([S3 version](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dsci/6007/videos/cloud-computing/1-2-what-is-a-cloud.mp4))</small> Though this was touched upon previously, here we go into more detail. After watching this video you should be able to describe the relationship between servers, switches, and racks in a hierarchical network topology.

Next we get into the [History of Cloud Computing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cloud-computing/lecture/EZ8d5/1-3-introduction-to-clouds-history) <small>([S3 version](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dsci/6007/videos/cloud-computing/1-3-introduction-to-clouds-history.mp4))</small>. History may seem unimportant to a field that moves as rapidly as ours, but in fact, a lot of the solutions to problems that face us today can be found in the past. After watching this video, you should be able to find parallels between today's cloud computing revolution and past eras of computing.

So, [what's new in today's clouds?](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cloud-computing/lecture/NjDZR/1-4-introduction-to-clouds-whats-new-in-todays-clouds) <small>([S3 version](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dsci/6007/videos/cloud-computing/1-4-introduction-to-clouds-whats-new-in-todays-clouds.mp4))</small> The answer, in short, is scale. After watching this video, you should be able to calculate the power usage efficiency of a datacenter which should give you an idea of how efficiency of scale is computed.

[New aspects of clouds](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cloud-computing/lecture/ezFQO/1-5-introduction-to-clouds-new-aspects-of-clouds) <small>([S3 version](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dsci/6007/videos/cloud-computing/1-5-introduction-to-clouds-new-aspects-of-clouds.mp4))</small> can be largely understood in terms of the \*aaS offerings. By the end of this lesson, you should know your \*aaS from a hole in the ground.

You've heard a lot about the [economics of clouds](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cloud-computing/lecture/hF8xj/1-6-introduction-to-clouds-economics-of-clouds) <small>([S3 version](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dsci/6007/videos/cloud-computing/1-6-introduction-to-clouds-economics-of-clouds.mp4))</small> already but here we go into more detail. The cloud promises to be economical, but only if you use it wisely, and that means provisioning only the resources you need and shutting them down when you are done with them. This lesson will help you with the sort of back-of-the-envelope calculations you will need to make in order to make sure you stay in budget. (_N.B._ that \$1,000 credit you got at the beginning of this course may seem like a lot, and it is, but if you aren't careful, you could blow through it before you know it.)
