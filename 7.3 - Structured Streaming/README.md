Watch [A Deep Dive Into Structured Streaming](https://www.slideshare.net/databricks/a-deep-dive-into-structured-streaming). Slides follow the video. You may find it easier to open the video in a separate window and then follow along with the slides on SlideShare.net/.

Then read through the [Structured Streaming Programming Guide](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html).

By the end of it, you should be able to develop a simple app using Structured Streaming.
