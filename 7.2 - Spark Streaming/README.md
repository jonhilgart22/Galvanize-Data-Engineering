Spark Streaming
-----

For this lesson we will be utilizing the high quality videos put together by the folks over at [DataStax](http://www.datastax.com/). DataStax is the lead commercial vender for [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/). In addition to Cassandra, their platform also includes [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/), [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/), and an implementation of [Gremlin](https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki). They have provided [courses](https://academy.datastax.com/courses) for all of these technologies which I recommend. For this lesson, we will be utilizing their course on [Spark](https://academy.datastax.com/resources/getting-started-apache-spark). You will notice two things about these videos compared to the edX videos we watched earlier. First: the course uses Scala instead of Python. Try not to let this get in the way. For at least most (if not all) of the examples, the Python equivalent should be fairly straight forward. Check the [Spark Streaming Programming Guide](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/streaming-programming-guide.html) for side-by-side comparisons of Scala, Java, and Python. Second: not surprisingly, the course does emphasize connectivity to Cassandra. Nonetheless, I have found it to be the best introduction to Spark Streaming that I've found. So again, don't let that distract you. For this lesson, we will be diving directly into the Spark Streaming lessons:

1. [Discretized Stream](https://academy.datastax.com/resources/getting-started-apache-spark?unit=spark-streaming-discretized-stream)
2. [Architecture](https://academy.datastax.com/resources/getting-started-apache-spark?unit=spark-streaming-architecture)
3. [First App](https://academy.datastax.com/resources/getting-started-apache-spark?unit=spark-streaming-first-app)
4. [Stateless Transformations](https://academy.datastax.com/resources/getting-started-apache-spark?unit=spark-streaming-stateless-transformations)
5. [Stateful Transformations](https://academy.datastax.com/resources/getting-started-apache-spark?unit=spark-streaming-stateful-transformations)
6. [Window Transformation](https://academy.datastax.com/resources/getting-started-apache-spark?unit=spark-streaming-window-transformation)
7. [Output Operations](https://academy.datastax.com/resources/getting-started-apache-spark?unit=spark-streaming-output-operations)
8. [Checkpointing and Recovery](https://academy.datastax.com/resources/getting-started-apache-spark?unit=spark-streaming-checkpointing-and-recovery)
9. [Persistence](https://academy.datastax.com/resources/getting-started-apache-spark?unit=spark-streaming-persistence)
10. [Controlling Parallelism](https://academy.datastax.com/resources/getting-started-apache-spark?unit=spark-streaming-controlling-parallelism)

Then look through the [Spark Streaming Programming Guide](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/streaming-programming-guide.html).
