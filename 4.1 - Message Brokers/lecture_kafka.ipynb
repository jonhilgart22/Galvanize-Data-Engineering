    "What is Kafka?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kafka is like TiVo for real time messages.\n",
    "- Producers write events.\n",
    "- Consumers process events when they can.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are events?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Events are messages or objects.\n",
    "- Think data structures containing fields.\n",
    "- Like SQL records or CSV records.\n",
    "\n",
    "How long does Kafka store events?\n",
    "\n",
    "- By default, for a week.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of today's lesson, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discuss what problem Kafka solves and why it exists\n",
    "- Discuss what problems Kafka does not solve, and for which you need\n",
    "  to integrate it with HBase and Spark Streaming.\n",
    "- Install and launch Kafka. \n",
    "- Implement Kafka to handle heavy message volumes using *partitions*,\n",
    "  *consumer groups*, and *replication*.\n",
    "- Implement Kafka *producers* and *consumers* that can send and\n",
    "  receive messages through Kafka. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Etymology\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it called Kafka?\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [Jay Kreps](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6878186)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The rationale was that it should be a writer because we were\n",
    "  building a distributed log or journal (a service dedicated to\n",
    "  writing). \n",
    "- The writer needed to be someone that (1) I liked, (2) sounded cool\n",
    "  as a name, (3) was dead (because it would be creepy to use the name\n",
    "  of someone who was alive).\n",

    "Year |Event\n",
    "---- |-----\n",
    "2011 |Open sourced at LinkedIn\n",
    "2012 |Version 0.7 released\n",
    "2012 |Graduated from Apache incubator status\n",
    "2013 |Version 0.8 released\n",
    "2014 |Confluent spins off from LinkedIn with goal to productize Kafka\n",

    "## Programming Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "What language is Kafka written in?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Written in Scala.\n",
    "- API supports Scala, Java, Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Does Kafka Exist\n",
    "\n",
    "LinkedInâ€™s motivation for Kafka: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Unified platform for handling all the data feeds.\n",
    " \n",
    "Kafka Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- High throughput to support high volume event feeds.\n",
    "- Support  processing of these feeds to create new, derived feeds.\n",
    "- Support large data backlogs to handle periodic ingestion from offline systems.\n",
    "- Support low-latency delivery to handle more traditional messaging use cases.\n",
    "- Guarantee fault-tolerance in the presence of machine failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kafka Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Image of a 2013 discussion of Kafka's Data Architecture at LinkedIn:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/kafka-linkedIn2013.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LinkedIn** \n",
    "    - Processes more than 800 billion events/day via Kafka. \n",
    "    - This is 175 TB of data.\n",
    "    - Primary types of data being processed through Kafka are:\n",
    "        - Metrics: operational telemetry data\n",
    "        - Tracking: everything a LinkedIn.com user does\n",
    "        - Queuing: between LinkedIn apps, e.g. for sending emails\n",
    "- **Netflix** \n",
    "    - Real time monitoring and event processing.\n",
    "- **Twitter** \n",
    "    - As part of their Storm and Heron  data pipelines.\n",
    "- **Spotify**\n",
    "    - Log delivery (from 4h down to 10s), Hadoop.\n",
    "- **Loggly** \n",
    "    - Log collection and processing.\n",
    "- **Mozilla** \n",
    "    - Telemetry data.\n",
    "    - Data that Firefox receives from browsers in the wild.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Is Kafka Fast\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fast writes:\n",
    "    - While Kafka persists all data to disk, essentially all writes go\n",
    "      to the page cache of OS, i.e. RAM.\n",
    "    - Configuration hardware specs and OS tuning.\n",
    "- Fast reads:\n",
    "    - Very efficient to transfer data from page cache to a network\n",
    "      socket\n",
    "    - Kafka uses the `sendfile()` system call to transfer data\n",
    "      directly from disk to network, without copying it into multiple\n",
    "      buffers.\n",
    "- Combination of the two = fast Kafka!\n",
    "    - For example, on a Kafka cluster where the consumers are mostly\n",
    "      caught up you will see no read activity on the disks as they\n",
    "      will be serving data entirely from cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kafka and Big Data Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is Kafka used in Big Data systems?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traditionally Big Data systems were batch-oriented.\n",
    "- There are many benefits to doing analytics in real time. \n",
    "- You can detect fraud, network intrusion, etc. and respond to events immediately.\n",
    "- Storm and Spark Streaming let you process data in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we need Kafka with Storm and Spark Streaming?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What happens when your data comes in faster than you can process it?\n",
    "- Kafka buffers data so your processes don't crash.\n",
    "- If systems crash or go offline for maintenance Kafka will let them replay the data.\n",
    "- Kafka stores data for a week by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kafka Analogies\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kafka is like a *Universal Power Supply* for data.\n",
    "- Kafka is like TiVo.\n",
    "- Kafka is like Twitter.\n",

    "<img src=\"images/kafka-spark-hbase.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kafka, Spark, HBase\n",
    "\n",
    "How does Kafka relate to HBase and Spark?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kafka, Spark Streaming, and HBase are frequently used together.\n",
    "- Kafka is the real time data pipeline.\n",
    "- Spark Streaming is the real time data processing engine.\n",
    "- HBase is the real time data storage.\n",
    "- Data comes in through Kafka, is processed by Spark Streaming, and is\n",
    "  then saved to HBase.\n",

    "\n",
    "What are *producers*, *consumer*, *brokers*?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kafka producers write messages to brokers.\n",
    "- Kafka brokers buffer and retain messages. By default they retain\n",
