Spark DataFrames
-----

In 2015, Spark introduced its own take on DataFrames which has since become the primary abstraction for data in Spark. In 2016, Spark 2.0 was released and Databricks worked with Berkeley to create [an edX course](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1%3ABerkeleyX%2BCS105x%2B1T2016/) to teach this new version of the Spark API. To get acquainted with Spark DataFrames, we will jump into the first lecture of this series. The first few videos are a review of what we have already and can be skipped. I include them for completeness:

1. [Welcome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBmV4mYUZE4) (1:57) - OPTIONAL
2. [Sources of Big Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZriVGvk6_A) (3:38) - OPTIONAL
3. [The Structure Spectrum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZwP8-YvixU) (4:50) - OPTIONAL
4. [Analysis, Big Data, and Apache Spark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1UENY1sG2c) (8:09)
5. [Apache Spark DataFrames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPS9wd3tjtU) (6:10)
6. [Apache Spark Transformations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jleReJ4ABs0) (12:48)
7. [Apache Spark Actions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCzidQ6hAhA) (5:14)
8. [Best Programming Practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rdg19pS_-mQ) (3:47)

Continue with week 2 of the same course. You may skip the first two videos. Again, I include them for completeness.

1. [The Big Data Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgU6-xqQnHw) (1:38) - OPTIONAL
2. [Cluster Computing Challenges and the Map Reduce Programming Paradigm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4l2WHvPtzE) (7:32) - OPTIONAL
3. [Apache Spark: Technology Trends, Opportunity, and Advantages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnHF-d95eWE) (9:02)
4. [Structured Data and the Structured Query Language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cYWUxzyVA) (10:06)
5. [Spark SQL and Spark DataFrames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkrVorCtTjo) (3:55)
6. [Spark Community and Resources](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqH2ipzFz_A) (2:49)
7. [Spark Research Papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvgNbmuvWWU) (0:52)

Familiarize yourself with [Datasets and DataFrames](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html#datasets-and-dataframes).

Then, watch the video on [Semi-Structured Web Server Logs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5wYyxMCF8). While it describes the edX lab and not ours, the data are not so different and you may find it helpful.

Finally, watch this short video discussing [Parquet vs Avro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY1dEfyFeHc).
