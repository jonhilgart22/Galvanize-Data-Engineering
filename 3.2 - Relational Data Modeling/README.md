Today we will get more into the theory behind the relational data model and what it means to have [tidy data](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf). We will begin with C.J. Date explaining Codd's original relational model towards the beginning of his [SQL and Relational Theory Master Class](https://player.oreilly.com/videos/0636920010005). You can skip to 14:34 and watch up through 29:46. By the end of this you should be able to identify and explain a candidate key, describe referential integrity, and define the eight relational algebra operations. (Note especially the difference between `union` and `join`. They both combine two tables, but one operates on rows while the other operates on columns.)

Next, go through Stanford's [Relational Design Overview](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/DB/RD/SelfPaced/courseware/ch-relational_design_theory/seq-vid-relational_design_overview/). The UI for this lesson is a little unusual in that you advance from one chapter to the next via a navigation bar at the top. Be sure to watch and complete all four videos and quizzes. By the end of this lesson, you should be able identify whether a data model is normalized and whether or not there exists a functional dependency between two columns.

Finally, read through the [10 Rules for a Better SQL Schema](https://www.periscopedata.com/blog/better-sql-schema.html)
