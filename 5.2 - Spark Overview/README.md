Introduction to Spark
---------------------

To introduce Spark, we will jump into [Week 5 of Hadoop Platform and Application Framework](https://www.coursera.org/learn/hadoop/home/week/5) which describes how Spark is an improvement over the Hadoop MapReduce framework. Feel free to peruse the previous weeks if you want to go deeper into some of the Hadoop topics we did not have time for.

Finally, familiarize yourself with the Spark Programming Guide section on [Resilient Distributed Datasets](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/programming-guide.html#resilient-distributed-datasets-rdds).
