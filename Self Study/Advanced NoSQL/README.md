Introduction to Apache Cassandra
-----

Begin with the first two parts of [DS101: Introduction to Apache Cassandra](https://academy.datastax.com/resources/ds101-introduction-cassandra):

1. [Relational Overview](https://academy.datastax.com/resources/ds101-introduction-cassandra?unit=introduction-relational-overview)
2. [Cassandra Overview](https://academy.datastax.com/resources/ds101-introduction-cassandra?unit=introduction-cassandra-overview)

There is some useful information in [Choosing a Distribution](https://academy.datastax.com/resources/ds101-introduction-cassandra?unit=introduction-choosing-distribution) but you can skip it if you are short on time.

Continue with [DS201: DataStax Enterprise Foundations of Apache Cassandra](https://academy.datastax.com/resources/ds201-foundations-apache-cassandra). You may skip the two introduction videos and the first quick win and jump to the video on CQL and continue with the lectures on the Cassandra Data Model and Application Connectivity:

4. [Quick Wins: CQL](https://academy.datastax.com/resources/ds201-foundations-apache-cassandra?unit=quick-wins-cql)
5. [Cassandra Data Model: Partitions](https://academy.datastax.com/resources/ds201-foundations-apache-cassandra?unit=cassandra-data-model-partitions)
6. [Cassandra Data Model: Clustering Columns](https://academy.datastax.com/resources/ds201-foundations-apache-cassandra?unit=cassandra-data-model-clustering-columns)
7. [Application Connectivity: Drivers](https://academy.datastax.com/resources/ds201-foundations-apache-cassandra?unit=application-connectivity-drivers)

When we get to Distributed Architecture, the lectures on [node](https://academy.datastax.com/resources/ds201-foundations-apache-cassandra?unit=distributed-architecture-node) and [ring](https://academy.datastax.com/resources/ds201-foundations-apache-cassandra?unit=distributed-architecture-ring) are optional, but you will definitely want to watch the video on [peer-to-peer](https://academy.datastax.com/resources/ds201-foundations-apache-cassandra?unit=distributed-architecture-peer-peer). Beyond that, watch according to your interest.
