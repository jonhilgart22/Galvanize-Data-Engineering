1) What does each letter stand for in CAP? Give a distributed systems example for each one.

&nbsp;&nbsp; C  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; P  

2) For each technology, select the CAP theorem combination that best applies:

| Technology |  |  | |  
|:-------:|:------:| :------:| :------:|
| RDMS | CA | AP | CP |
| Cassandra | CA | AP | CP |
| Zookeeper | CA | AP | CP |
| Medusa | CA | AP | CP |
| Octosnail | CA | AP | CP |

3) List the 2 biggest downsides of NoSQL solutions

&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.


4) What is Cassandra's core abstraction that enables linear scaling?

&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Short term leases  
&nbsp;&nbsp; B. Consistent hashing  
&nbsp;&nbsp; C. Messaging  
&nbsp;&nbsp; D. Open source  
&nbsp;&nbsp; E. Hiring people from Standford  
&nbsp;&nbsp; F. Spending billions of dollars 

5) How are SQL and CQL related?

<br>
<br>

Optional) We have a ternary clock with numbers 0, 1, 2. What is the solution to `-7 mod 3` (aka Which node do we hash/store the value on)? __Hint__: Visualize the node sequence.
