    "HDFS â€“ or Hadoop Distributed File System is the primary storage system used for Hadoop. It is the key tool for managing Big Data and supporting analytic applications in a scalable, cheap and rapid way. Hadoop is usually used on low-cost commodity machines, where server failures are fairly common. To accommodate a high failure environment the file system is designed to distribute data throughout different servers in different server racks making the data highly available. Moreover, when HDFS takes in data it breaks it down into smaller blocks that get assigned to different nodes in a cluster which allows for parallel processing, increasing the speed in which the data is managed.\n",
