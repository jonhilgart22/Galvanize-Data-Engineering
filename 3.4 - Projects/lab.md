Proposal
--------

For this assignment, you must submit two deliverables:

1. Proof that you can access your data source. This can be in the form of a Jupyter notebook with output included, or a Python script and a data file it generates. It should not be extensive. I just want to make sure that you can physically get the data you need for this project.

2. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) describing your proposed architecture. You will iterate on this as you go, but for now start with something simple. It may be similar to one of the [architectures](../Lab Overview.ipynb) we've already covered in class.
