Not Only SQL

#### By the end of this article you should have:

- Completed the **Deeper into SQL** lesson in Udacity's *Intro to Relational Databases* course
- Installed pgAdmin 4

Mongo is a handy way to store JSON objects, but when it comes to analytics, it leaves much to be desired. In today's lesson, we will be returning to SQL. You may recall in the first week of DSCI6002, we covered [SQL basics](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql#sql-basics). For this lesson, I'd like you to work through Udacity's [Intro to Relational Databases](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud197) course. Some of this may feel redundant, but it is important, before class, that you be comfortable data types, keys, and creating tables. It is worth noting that for today's lab, our first table will _not_ be normalized as we will be storing the raw JSON we get from Twitter. It is important that you can explain _why_ that data is not in first (let alone third) normal form, especially because normalizing it will be your assignment tomorrow.

You will also want to familiarize yourself with the [PostgreSQL Tutorial](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/).

Finally, download and install the latest version of [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/macos4.php).
