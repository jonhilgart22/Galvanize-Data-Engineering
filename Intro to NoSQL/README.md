- Completed the **Working with MongoDB** lesson in Udacity's *Data Wrangling with MongoDB* course

---

For this module, we will use the lesson developed by the folks at MongoDB (formerly 10gen) on [Data Wrangling with MongoDB](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-wrangling-with-mongodb--ud032). We are going to skip the first 2/3 of the course and jump to the [Intro to MongoDB](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud032/lessons/745498943/concepts/7597386010923), however you may want to skim over the first few lessons as well. Much of the **Data Extraction Fundamentals** lesson (such as the discussion of [CSV](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud032/lessons/491558559/concepts/7419485430923) and [JSON](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud032/lessons/491558559/concepts/7419485510923)) should be a review for you at this point, but if you feel unsure of your knowledge there, you may want to watch those videos. **Data in More Complex Formats** includes sections on [XML](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud032/lessons/698949179/concepts/7625885560923) and web [scraping](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud032/lessons/698949179/concepts/7121012560923), which are not required for this course, but may be useful to you in the future, so you may want to bookmark them for later.

By the end of the **Working with MongoDB** lesson you should feel comfortable with all the basic CRUD operations that can be done using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community) and [PyMongo](https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/). The following lesson on [**Analyzing Data**](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud032/lessons/760758686/concepts/8051386250923) is not required but is strongly recommended if you intend to do anything with MongoDB beyond the scope of this lesson (such as for your final project or your practicum).

Other videos you might find interesting are: 

- this (slightly dated) [Introduction to MongoDB & PyMongo](https://vimeo.com/32830423)
- this tutorial on [NoSQL Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYtE-Irbd7E&index=32&list=PLGVZCDnMOq0rzDLHi5WxWmN5vueHU5Ar7) (essentially how to build something like MongoDB but entirely in Python)
- this rather crude parody called "[MongoDB is Web Scale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs)"
- this advertisement for [Redis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=wniS9E-cHcs), another NoSQL database of note, quite different from MongoDB
